      "Greenland is a huge island in the far, far north of the world. The weather there is very harsh and cold. Even the hottest summer day in Greenland is like a cool winter's day in England. In the summer months, the sun never sets; it is light all through the night. The warmest part of the island is on the south coast and that is where most Greenlanders live. However, it is still a very hard place to live because of the cold. Over the years, different groups of people have tried to live in Greenland, but most found it too difficult. One man who did live there, and one of the most famous Greenlanders, was 'Erik the Red'. Erik's name might have come from the colour of his hair and beard, or possibly because of his fiery temper. About 1000 years ago, Erik was sent away from his home in Iceland. He sailed away from this small ice-covered island to a great big ice-covered island. This island had no name yet and no one lived there, so Erik made it his home. The old stories of Iceland say that Erik became bored and lonely and wanted to persuade other people to come and live on this freezing-cold island with him. Erik had an idea. He called the island ”Greenland” and pretended that it was lovely, warm and ... green. His trick worked. When the people from Iceland heard about this perfect place called ”Greenland”, many of them decided to join Erik. About 300 of them packed up their belongings and set off to join him. Although life was hard, these people lived on Greenland for many years and it became their home. They built houses that were snug and strong from stone, wood and turf. They planted crops and kept cows, goats and sheep that they had brought with them all the way from Iceland. However, 500 years later, there was nothing left of Erik and his friends in Greenland. What happened to them is still a mystery."

      "Plastic is a material we use every day.  The first plastics were made more than 100 years ago from parts of plants. Plastics are now made from oil, coal and natural gas. We are using up these things so fast that the Earth’s supplies may run out. Because of this, scientists are investigating new ideas for making plastics from plants such as sweet potato, bamboo and flax. Things made from plastic can be useful for people but bad for the planet. Some plastics can last for a long time without wearing out, and can be difficult to get rid of when they are not needed. They can remain in rubbish dumps called landfill sites for hundreds of years. Landfills can be smelly, ugly, and harmful to our planet. Recycling is a good way to get rid of unwanted plastics. Recycled waste materials can be used again to make new products. This can be difficult as different types of plastic need to be recycled in different ways. Some kinds of plastics can be melted down and used to make new things such as bags and bottles. Others can be made into fibres (strands of material) for clothing. Another way to protect the environment is to use canvas bags for shopping rather than plastic ones. A lot of plastic objects can also be reused. Plastic bottles can be refilled many times, rather than throwing them away once they are empty. Unwanted plastic goods such as CDs and toys can be sold or given away to charity shops."

      "Bats are flying mammals. They are warm blooded creatures that hibernate in winter. Growing warmth from the sun wakes them from sleep in March or April. In many British gardens, they can  be seen at dusk – and occasionally even in daytime – right through to October or even later. Their diet consists entirely of insects which they detect by echo-location, usually in flight. The sound waves issued through their mouths or noses help them to navigate, as well as to find food. Britain has 17 different species of bat. A lot of these have been recorded in gardens and several species may roost in houses. In many parts of the world, bat populations have declined dramatically. British bats are under threat and many species are now much less common than they used to be. Some species of British bat are very rare and a few species are close to extinction. Bats normally remain hidden during the day and their small, black droppings in your roof space often provide the only evidence of their presence. Mice droppings are hard but those of bats consist of insect skeletons and crumble to dust if rubbed between finger and thumb. All bat species and their roosts are protected by law because they are so vulnerable. British bats are quite harmless to humans and should not be disturbed."

      "Guide dogs help people who are blind or visually impaired move around safely, and often transform their lives. They are usually allowed anywhere that the public can go, even where other dogs aren’t allowed. In the United States, guide dogs are called seeing eye dogs. Guide dogs must learn not to obey any command that might put their owner in danger. This is is perhaps the most amazing thing about guide dogs: they know when to follow their owner's commands and when they should disobey their owner to keep them safe. This is very important at road crossings, where the owner and dog must work very closely together to cross safely. When they reach the curb, the dog stops and signals to the owner that they have reached a crossing. Dogs cannot recognise the colour of traffic lights, so the owner must decide when it is safe to cross the road. The owner listens to the flow of traffic to judge when the light has changed and then gives the command ‘forward’. If there is no danger, the dog crosses the road.  If there are cars coming, the dog waits until they pass and then crosses. The guide dog doesn’t know where they are going, so it must follow the owner’s instructions. The owner can’t see obstacles so the guide dog must help the owner to avoid them. Not all dogs are suited to the life of a guide dog. Puppies born to be guide dogs have to be intelligent and good- natured; it is important that they aren’t nervous of crowds or frightened by sudden noises.  When it is eight weeks old, the puppy sets out on its journey to become a guide dog. It goes to live with a volunteer ‘puppy-walker’, who teaches the pup to follow simple commands and to walk on a lead.  The puppy-walker also takes it to busy town centres and on different kinds of public transport. The puppy is introduced to the sights, sounds and smells of a world in which it will play such an important part. When the puppy is about a year old, it returns to the guide dog centre for the next part of its training. It can be hard for puppy-walkers to say goodbye to a puppy, but they have the satisfaction of knowing they have helped to raise a dog that will one day be someone’s eyes. Guide dogs work hard and there is no room for fun during the working day. If you see a guide dog, you should leave it alone so that it can concentrate on helping its owner.  At the end of the day, however, a guide dog will play just like an ordinary pet.",

    title: "All About Potatoes",
    level: "Intermediate",
    tags: ["food", "history"],
    content:
      "Potatoes were first grown for food in South America thousands of years ago. People found a way to preserve them by leaving them out at night in the cold and then warming them in the sun the following day. During the day, the potatoes were crushed by stamping on them. After doing this for five days, a potato pulp was made which could be stored and kept for up to ten years in case crops failed. In 1532 Spanish traders, who had been searching for gold, brought potatoes back from South America and used them on board ships as food. It was not long before farmers in Spain began to grow them as crops and the potato spread across the rest of Europe. They were regarded with suspicion, however, and many people thought they weren’t suitable for humans to eat, partly because of their odd shape. In some places, they were grown just as food for animals. There are different opinions about how the potato came to Britain in the late 1500s. One view is that Spanish fishermen ate potatoes on their fishing trips to the North Sea. On their way home, they would land in Ireland to put salt on fish they had caught to stop it rotting. It is believed that the sailors gave some of their potatoes to the farmers who grew them in the rich Irish soil. Another view is that Sir Walter Raleigh, a British explorer who went to the Americas many times, brought potatoes back to his Irish farm and planted them there. It is said that he gave a potato plant to Queen Elizabeth I of England as a gift, and to celebrate, a royal feast was held to eat the potatoes. Legend has it that the cooks threw away the potatoes and instead served up the boiled stems and leaves (which are poisonous). This made everyone very ill and potatoes were then banned from the royal menu. Potatoes are very popular today and, despite what some people think, they are also good for you. A baked potato contains a surprisingly large amount of vitamin C – and more fibre than two slices of wholemeal bread. Potatoes also provide carbohydrates and other important nutrients like vitamin B6. They are low in fat too, provided you don’t fry them or add lots of butter! Potatoes are easy to grow. This makes them a perfect crop for farmers in the developing world, who can grow a nutritious food in poor soil. There are plenty of different varieties to choose from and they usually produce a good harvest.",

      "Diwali is an important Indian festival. Diwali is also known as the Festival of Lights. People in India and Nepal celebrate Diwali to mark the end of the Hindu calendar year. Diwali is a national holiday in India and Nepal. The Diwali celebrations last for five days.  Many other countries around the world hold multicultural events to mark the holiday, too. During Diwali, people light lamps and pray for good health, peace and wisdom. They clean their homes, and decorate their doorways with pictures made with painted rice, called rangoli. Children light fireworks and adults buy new clothes and give gifts and sweets to their family and friends. The fourth day of Diwali marks the start of the New Year and is the most important day of the festival. People pray to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth for prosperity in the coming year.",

    title: "The Story of Coffee",
    level: "Intermediate",
    tags: ["food", "history"],
    content:
      "Many people enjoy a cup of coffee at their local coffee shop, but few people know the story of coffee and how it is produced. Coffee growing is a global industry. Research shows that as many as a third of the world's population are coffee drinkers. Some people enjoy drinking coffee for its rich smell and taste. Others like the awakening effect of caffeine, a chemical in coffee. Coffee trees are native to eastern Africa and areas of the Arabian Peninsula. Coffee was first grown and traded in the 15th century. Back then, most coffee came from the country we now know as Yemen. Before long, coffee was in high demand all over the Middle East. By the seventeenth century coffee had been introduced to Europe. European traders started bringing coffee plants to other parts of the world. The Dutch brought coffee to the islands of Indonesia. By the 20th century, most of the world's production came from Central and South America. Today, Brazil is the largest producer of coffee in the world. Most people know what a coffee bean looks like, but what about the plant? Coffee trees can grow up to nine metres high, but they are cut short for production. These trees have shiny dark green leaves that grow on opposite sides of each other on a stem. The plant produces a fruit that is called a coffee cherry. When the coffee cherries are ripe and ready to pick, they are bright, red and firm. Inside the fruits are the green coffee beans. After these beans are roasted at high temperatures they are ready to be made into a drink. The two most important kinds of coffee plants are arabica and robusta. Arabica coffee makes up around 70% of the world's production. These trees produce a fine and mild coffee with a rich smell. Robusta has more caffeine than arabica. It is usually mixed with other coffee beans or used for instant coffee. Most of the world's robusta is grown in Central and Western Africa. It can also be found in parts of Southeast Asia and Brazil. Robusta is less costly to grow because it is more resistant to diseases than the arabica plant. Also, robusta plants can survive in a warmer climate. There may only be two main kinds of coffee plants, but geography and climate differences have a big effect on how coffee tastes. For example, coffee grown in Ethiopia is known for its lively, sharp taste and its flowery smell. Coffee from the island of Sumatra is full bodied, with an earthy and intense taste. Coffee roasters combine beans from different areas to make coffees with different tastes and qualities. One popular story about the discovery of coffee long ago is about Kaldi, a goat keeper. Kaldi was looking after his goats in the highlands of Ethiopia where coffee trees have grown for centuries. He noticed that his goats became very excited and active after eating small fruits from a tree. Kaldi reported this discovery to a group of religious workers. When they made a drink out of the fruit, the religious workers realized they could stay awake for long hours of prayer. This knowledge about coffee soon spread all over the world. In the USA, the number of specialty coffee shops has increased greatly over the years. In 1995 there were around 5000 shops and sellers specializing in coffee. By 2006, there were almost 24,000 coffee shops in the United States. It is hard to walk down a street in an American city without coming across a coffee shop. The Specialty Coffee Association of America holds a yearly competition for the people who prepare coffee drinks, known as baristas. The best baristas from different areas of the country gather to make three coffee drinks. A group of coffee experts judges them. The baristas take their job very seriously. They have fifteen minutes to make three kinds of coffee drinks: an espresso, a cappuccino, and a specialty drink of their own invention. The best baristas in the country then compete for the national award. Coffee is the second most heavily traded product in the world after oil. A coffee bean goes from a series of producers, exporters, importers, roasters and sellers. This long chain of production has major social and political effects. For example, some coffee producers and drinkers are concerned about the Fair Trade movement. The aim of this movement is to make sure that coffee farmers around the world get a fair price for their harvest. Poor farmers are organized into groups called cooperatives. They are guaranteed money under this system. Even if the market price for coffee drops, these farmers can earn enough money to live on. Some critics of the Fair Trade movement argue that coffee farmers still do not receive a fair amount of money for their work. And some economists argue that Fair Trade creates too large a supply of coffee. There are also environmental concerns within the coffee industry. Industrial coffee production can have a bad effect on nature. The chemicals used on large coffee farms can hurt soil and water sources. These large farms also cut down many trees to make room for coffee plants. This threatens native plants and birds. Environmental organizations have worked to create rules for producing coffee in environmentally friendly ways. Many coffee drinkers buy this coffee to support their efforts. So, the next time you enjoy your morning coffee, you can think about its rich history and wide popularity. And you can imagine the long distances it travelled to end up in your cup.",
